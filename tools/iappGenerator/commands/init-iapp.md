# 🔑 Initializing your iApp

The **iApp Generator CLI** simplifies the setup of your iApp by guiding you through a step-by-step initialization process.

## 🏗 Step 1: Define Your Project

Run:

```sh
iapp init
```

You will be prompted to provide:

- **Project name** – A folder with this name will be created to store project files.
- **Language selection** – Choose between **JavaScript**, **Python**, etc.
- **Project mode** – Select **Basic** (Hello-World setup) or **Advanced** (full debug capabilities).
