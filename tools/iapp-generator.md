# ðŸ¤– iApp Generator

## What is the iApp Generator?

**iApp Generator** (iExec Application Generator) is a CLI tool to create, test,
and deploy **iExec Applications** (iApps) that run in a **Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE)**. It simplifies the process of building decentralized,
confidential applications without requiring deep knowledge of confidential
computing technologies. With the iApp Generator, you can:

- **Create a basic application structure** ready to run on a decentralized
  worker in a TEE.
- **Test your application locally** in **Debug Mode**, enabling fast iteration
  and troubleshooting.
- **Deploy your iApp** as a confidential application on the iExec protocol.

## Why Use the iApp Generator?

Building decentralized, confidential applications (iApps) involves ensuring both
security and confidentiality of your data and code. The iApp Generator abstracts
away the complexity by offering a **simple, guided setup**, letting you focus on
**developing the application logic**. With the iApp Generator, you can easily
manage the entire development lifecycle of your iApp:
