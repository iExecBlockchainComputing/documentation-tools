# ðŸ§  iExec for AI


The iExec Platforms delivers several tools specifically for AI developers. Hereâ€™s how iExec can help develop, deploy and execute confidential AI applications.



## Confidential AI & Secure Compute Services

iExecâ€™s Confidential AI framework leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX and Intel TDX. This ensures:

* Data privacy: AI computations are protected end-to-end.
* Secure AI training & inference: models & data are encrypted throughout processing; they can never be accessed by unauthorized entities.


## AI Monetization

iExec provides all the tools to easily monetize your datasets, your models, your agents and your AI applications; encrypt it, push it, set a price and youâ€™re done! The iExec Platform preserves the ownership of your digital assets: whatever
happens, your data, models and agents will always be yours!


## Decentralized & Scalable Computing

iExec provides AI builders with a decentralized cloud computing infrastructure where they can access powerful
compute resources on-demand. Scale AI applications seamlessly, without dependency on centralized cloud providers
and ensure fair & transparent execution via blockchain-based verification.


## AI Agent & GenAI Trust Layer
iExec integrates automation tools such as the iApp Generator, allowing AI developers to:

* Easily create trusted AI agents.
* Leverage secure off-chain AI execution while integrating with smart contracts.


## Web3 & Decentralized AI (DeAI) Integration

iExec is positioned at the intersection of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) and DeAI (Decentralized AI), allowing AI applications to:

* Operate transparently in a trust-driven ecosystem.
* Utilize blockchain-based consensus for AI validation.


## Flexible Compute Resource Access

Through worker pools, AI developers can:

* Run AI workloads on decentralized hardware, including CPUs and GPUs.
* Access specialized computing resources, such as confidential GPUs for AI/ML model training.

## Interoperability & Compatibility

iExec supports:

* Off-chain AI computation triggered by smart contracts.
* Seamless execution of existing AI workloads using Intel TDX, eliminating the need for application modification.
