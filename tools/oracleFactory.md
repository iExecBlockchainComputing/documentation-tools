# 🧙 Oracle Factory

Oracle Factory introduces a streamlined and efficient way for developers to
integrate real-world data into blockchain applications. Leveraging the power of
the iExec decentralized cloud infrastructure, Oracle Factory ensures the
creation of reliable and trustworthy oracles.

Key features of Oracle Factory include:

- **Create Oracle** — This method allows for the creation of custom oracles from
  any API, with a limitation of one data return per oracle. This feature is
  pivotal in fetching specific, relevant data for decentralized applications.
- **Update Oracle** — This method ensures that the oracle stays current by
  fetching the latest data from its linked API. It maintains the oracle's
  relevance and accuracy, crucial for real-time data-dependent applications.
- **Read Oracle** — This method allows users to retrieve the value from the
  oracle.

Oracles created with Oracle Factory can be showcased in a dedicated
[gallery](https://oracle-factory.iex.ec/gallery), allowing for broader
accessibility and application.

With its cross-chain functionality, extending from the iExec Sidechain to
networks like Ethereum and Polygon, Oracle Factory demonstrates remarkable
versatility. It is a critical tool for developers looking to bridge the gap
between blockchain and the real world, democratizing access to reliable data for
DApps.
