# iDapp

Building your own iDapp is essential if you want to utilize our development
tools to their full potential.

### What is an iDapp?

An iDapp is an iExec TEE decentralized application that operates within a
decentralized infrastructure based on the SCONE TEE framework. This framework
ensures full privacy during the execution of the Dapp.

### In which languages can I build my iDapp?

It depends on the SCONE TEE framework. Currently, you can use Go, Rust, Python,
and JavaScript.

### How to build my iDapp?

To build your iDapp, you can follow the
[protocol documentation](https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/for-developers/your-first-app).
We are continuously working on aspects to streamline and simplify your iDapp
development experience.
