# DataProtector Sharing (which is awesome)

Part of DataProtector, "Sharing" is a special module that includes a set of
methods for you to **distribute and monetise your protected data**.

That includes:

- Free sharing
- Renting
- Include in a subscription bundle
- Selling

One of the key aspects is that your protected data will be managed by a special
Data Sharing smart-contract.

Let's try to make it more visual:

This special smart-contract will be responsible for **enforcing governance**
over your protected data, based on your distribution choices. (renting, selling,
etc.)

## Why is it different from `DataProtector Core`?

With `DataProtector Core`, you can **grant access** to your protected data **to
a specific user**.

- You need to know the user's Ethereum address.
- You'll have to sign a transaction at the moment you grant the access.
- You define a number of times the user can access the data.

With `DataProtector Sharing`, you can **distribute** your protected data to **a
wider audience**.

- You don't need to know the user's Ethereum address.
- You don't need to sign a transaction at the moment of distribution (but the
  user who wants to access your content will).
- Any user can access your content as long as they comply with your distribution
  and monetization choices.
