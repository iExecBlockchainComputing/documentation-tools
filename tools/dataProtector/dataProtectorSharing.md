**Data Sharing – Collection Methods**

A **collection** is a way to group protected data for distribution through the Data Sharing module. The Data Sharing smart contract operates on data within these collections. Data must be organized into a collection before selecting a distribution method, and data owners can manage multiple collections simultaneously.

### **Distribution Options**

Depending on how you want to share your data, you can choose from these options:

---

### **1. Not Distributed**  
**Definition:** Only *you* (the data owner) can view the data.

**Example:**  
You’re developing a new research report. It’s not ready to share yet, so you keep it private in your collection until it’s complete.

---

### **2. Free**  
**Definition:** You let others access the data for free, possibly for a limited time.

**How It Works:**  
- Similar to renting but with **no payment required**.
- Can be time-limited, like a promotional giveaway.

**Example:**  
You’re launching a new app and want to promote it. You offer a free dataset for 7 days to attract new users. After 7 days, access expires unless you extend it.

### **3. For Rent**  
**Definition:** Others can pay to access your data for a limited time.

**How It Works:**  
- **One-time payment** for a fixed rental period.
- **Guaranteed access** during the rental period, even if the owner de-lists the data.
- **Renewal** requires a new payment based on the latest terms.

**Example:**  
You have a database of market trends. A company pays $100 to access it for 30 days. Even if you change the price or remove the data, they retain access until the 30 days are up.

### **4. Included in Subscription**  
**Definition:** Data can be bundled into subscription plans where users pay regularly for continuous access.

**How It Works:**  
- **Recurring payments** (monthly, annually, etc.).
- **Bundled access** to all data in the subscription.
- Owners can **add new data** anytime, but cannot **remove existing data** if there are active subscribers.

**Example:**  
You run a subscription service where members pay $50/month for premium reports. As long as they keep paying, they get access to all the reports. You can add new reports anytime, but you can’t remove existing ones if people are subscribed.

---

### **5. Both For Rent and Included in Subscription**  
**Definition:** Data can be available for both rental and subscription simultaneously.

**How It Works:**  
- Users can choose to **rent** data temporarily or **subscribe** for ongoing access.

**Example:**  
You have an advanced analytics report:
- Company A rents it for $200 for one month.
- Company B subscribes to your service for $50/month and gets the same report along with other data.

---

### **6. For Sale**  
**Definition:** Data is sold outright for a one-time payment, with **permanent access**.

**How It Works:**  
- Data ownership transfers to the buyer.
- No time restrictions after purchase.

**Example:**  
You create a unique digital artwork (like an NFT). You sell it for $500. Once purchased, the buyer owns it permanently.

### **Key Differences Between Rent and Subscription**

| **Aspect**        | **Rent**                                              | **Subscription**                                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Type**   | Temporary access for a fixed period.                  | Ongoing access as long as payments are made.            |
| **Payment Model** | One-time payment per rental.                         | Recurring payments (e.g., monthly).                     |
| **Duration**      | Fixed; access ends when the rental term expires.      | Continuous; access until the subscription is canceled.  |
| **Flexibility**   | Users must renew manually.                           | Auto-renewal for uninterrupted access.                  |
| **Content Changes** | Data remains unchanged during rental.               | New data can be added, but existing data cannot be removed if active subscribers exist. |
