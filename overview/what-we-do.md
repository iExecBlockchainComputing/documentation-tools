# 💡 What we do

iExec offers a unique and innovative solution to protect and grow the value of
your digital estate\*. Its decentralized nature, built-in blockchain protocol,
and support for cutting-edge cryptographic technologies make it an ideal choice
for individuals and organizations seeking to optimize their computing resources
while prioritizing security and privacy.

If you are a developer interested in **privacy**, **ownership**, and
**monetization**, iExec is the perfect platform for you.

iExec offers developers the ability to build and deploy their decentralized
applications. This means that data is stored on a decentralized network,
ensuring that they are protected from any unauthorized access. Additionally,
iExec uses advanced **confidential computing** techniques to ensure that data
remain secure and private even when processed on untrusted remote servers. That
guarantees that data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering, even
if the underlying hardware or operating system is compromised. Thus, iExec
technology is built following a privacy-by-design principle, which guarantees
that no one can access or copy users’ and developers’ data unless explicitly
granted by their respective owners.

iExec offers developers the ability to retain ownership of their applications
and data. This is because iExec is a decentralized platform leveraging
**Ethereum** blockchain technology. Access control rules are stored in
blockchain smart contracts and therefore cannot be modified by anyone. This way,
data owners can grant or revoke access to their data as needed. You retain
complete control over your data and applications, ensuring that you have
complete ownership and control&#x20;

Finally, iExec offers developers the ability to **monetize their applications
and data**. Thanks to iExec, developers can easily rent their applications
following a simple pay-per-task model and allow their users to monetize the
usage of their own data. Additionally, iExec offers developers the ability to
earn rewards for sharing their computing resources with the network.

By combining these methods, iExec aims to provide the technology for developers
to **build Web3 applications** that allow users to store, process, and share
their data while maintaining control over its usage and privacy.

_\*digital estate represents every digital asset that you own and can create
value from. This can be from an email address to an entire application._
