# Privacy Enhancing Marketing

The Web3 ecosystem grants users the power to employ blockchain wallets for
storing and managing their digital assets. These wallets are often used to
represent a user's digital identity based on their personally identifiable
information. This presents a huge privacy risk due to the ledger housing their
assets and their transaction history.

A central use case of iExec, privacy-enhancing marketing, provides a novel
approach to communications between Web3 users and decentralized applications
(dApps) while prioritizing user privacy and consent. This approach combined
targeted marketing and user engagement without compromising the privacy of
individuals. Importantly, these tools empower users to monetize direct marketing
actions, creating a more equitable and user-centric ecosystem.

Key Components of Privacy-Enhancing Marketing:

- **User Consent Management**: Users have the power to explicitly authorize the
  sharing of their personal data with third parties.
- **Secure Data Sharing Protocols**: Confidential computing technology allows
  for secure data sharing between users and third parties.
- **Privacy-Preserving Communication Channels**: Third parties use secured
  communications channels to contact users without accessing the user's personal
  data directly.
- **Targeted marketing without personal data exposure**: Third parties can
  execute targeted marketing campaigns without the need to directly access your
  users' personal data.
- **Monetizing direct marketing actions**: Users are empowered to monetize their
  engagement with direct marketing campaigns. By participating in targeted
  marketing efforts, users can earn rewards such as cryptocurrency or utility
  tokens.
- One of the key goals of this use case is to foster a mutually beneficial
  relationship whereby users can share their preferences and interests while
  maintaining control over their privacy. This new paradigm for communication
  and engagement in the Web3 ecosystem allows you to build trust-based
  relationships with your users. Leveraging cutting-edge privacy-preserving
  technologies and prioritizing user consent allows Web3 users and distributed
  applications to interact and share information without compromising user
  privacy. Of key interest to users is the ability to monetize their involvement
  in direct marketing actions, fostering a more equitable and user-centric
  digital environment.
