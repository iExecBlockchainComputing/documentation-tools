# ðŸ“½ Use case demo

Here you'll find several use cases built using iExec's **tools**. These examples
demonstrate ways to use iExec's features across multiple industries and
applications to ensure data **privacy** and **ownership** while sharing and
**monetizing computing resources**.

These examples combine our tools in different ways. For example, the
[Web3Messaging](./use-case-demo/privacy-enhancing-marketing.md)
use case uses the Web3Mail and Web3Telegram tools to send directed communications to a
user's email or telegram inbox. It employs the DataProtector tool to hide the user's email
address or the Telegram ID.


### Integration opportunities

The [content creator](./use-case-demo/content-creator.md) use case, powered by
our DataProtector SDK, gives a clean example of how our tools can integrate with
your application. This use case showcases how a user can create and monetize
content and use smart contracts to earn compensation when their content is
accessed. This tool is a great candidate for applications such as a website to
share instructional videos. You can recruit a group of creators who are
automatically compensated when certain conditions are met, such as view length
and audience engagement. Using our DataProtector SDK within your web application
shields users from the complexity of blockchain while still delivering to them
the benefits of distributed ledger and smart contract technologies.
