# ✉ Web3Mail

Web3Mail offers developers methods to create apps that:

- enable an entity (such as a (d)app provider or an end-user) to email an Ethereum account holder without knowing their email address
- eliminate the need for end-users to share their email address with multiple third parties, reducing the risk of data breaches and spam.

Web3Mail is composed of 3 methods:

- **fetchMyContacts**—that enables an entity to retrieve a list of Ethereum accounts whose owners have authorized the entity to email them
- **fetchUserContacts**—that enables anyone to retrieve a list of Ethereum accounts whose owners have authorized a given entity to email them
- **sendEmail**—that allows an entity to email a user knowing only her Ethereum account.
