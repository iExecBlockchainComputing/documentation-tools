# ðŸ§™â™‚ Oracle Factory

The iExec Oracle Factory is a service that facilitates the creation of custom oracles using either pre-set or user-defined APIs. Its objective is to simplify the oracle creation process for developers and other users.

iExec Oracle Factory's functionality is underpinned by the iExec's Web3 Marketplace infrastructure. The iExec Proof of Contribution consensus protocol is used for certifying the results returned by the oracles, ensuring their reliability for on-chain settlement of off-chain events. This guarantees that the data provided to the blockchain can be trusted.

Created oracles can be made available in a [gallery](https://oracle-factory.iex.ec/gallery) for use in decentralized applications (DApps). The factory also provides support for oracle migration to the new production chains, allowing users to stay up-to-date with technological advancements.

Moreover, the Oracle Factory has cross-chain capabilities, with its reach extending from iExec Sidechain to Ethereum, or Polygon. This enhances the tool's versatility in the DApps space.

The iExec Oracle Factory is designed for ease of use, enabling developers to create custom oracles quickly. By providing a more straightforward process, the service aims to democratize access to reliable data for blockchain applications.
