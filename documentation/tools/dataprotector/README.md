{% hint style="info" %}
We have recently released **a new version** of the DataProtector SDK.<br/>
Check out the [latest documentation](https://beta.tools.docs.iex.ec/tools/dataProtector.html) üéâ

The DataProtector tool allows application developers to provide users with unparalleled ownership over their data. End users gain the ability to invoke iExec apps without ever exposing their data to any other party. They gain complete privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive classes of data. 

This approach to data management relies on:

* end-to-end encryption of data with access controlled entirely by the owner of the data
* confidential computing technology that ensures only authorized apps are permitted access to a user's data
* smart contracts to manage an iExec application's permissions for a user's encrypted data

The DataProtector SDK encompasses the following suite of methods:

* **protectData**‚Äîsafeguards data by encrypting it and recording ownership as an NFT
* **grantAccess**‚Äîauthorizes an application to process a user's data without exposing the data to any external system or user review
* **revokeAllAccessObservable**‚Äîremoves all access granted to any iExec applications or user for a `protectedData` object
* **revokeOneAccess**‚Äîremoves a specific access previously granted on a `protectedData`
* **fetchProtectedData**‚Äîretrieve a list of all protected data for one owner and/or data schema
* **fetchGrantedAccess**‚Äîretrieve a list of all authorized users and applications for a `protectedData` object containing a user's data
* **processProtectedData**‚Äîprocess a `protectedData` object containing a user's data with a specified iExec application
* **transferOwnership**‚Äîtransfer a protectedData object to a new owner
